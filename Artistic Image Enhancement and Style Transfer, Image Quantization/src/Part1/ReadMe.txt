Important Instructions: 
	We are using relative referencing to include modules among different parts of the Assignment hence to execute the code properly,
	you need to be in the parent directory of the 'src' directory and run the following commands to execute each part




for part1 
		python -m src.Part1.part1 src/Part1/input_img.jpg
		
		Second argument is the path to input image
		generated images will be saved in 'part1_generated_images' folder in the executing directory





Thankyou for understanding
